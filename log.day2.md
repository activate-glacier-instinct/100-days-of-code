# 100 Days Of Code - Log

================

## Day 2

Date: 08/01/23

================

> Goal: make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Fixed the build so that it renders on CI/CD deployments
- Added a test pipeline job that run Playwright
    - Need to make the build and deploy job depend on the test job
- Design
    - Made a mood board here https://www.figma.com/file/EACX3PwCLrEc2q3oHRtxU4/Portfolio---Moodboard?node-id=0%3A1
    - Wanted to design something quick and nice, but ran out of time
    - I've settled on the style and themes 

### **Challenges**:
- Small issues took up a lot of time
- Design research didn't feel like coding, but you can't code something without a plan and making a design is the best way to plan the UI

### **Thoughts**: 

- Really enjoying SvelteKit
    - Bundle is 99kb
    - Loved this interactive learning environment https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/prerender
- Design seems to depend on drawing lines, physics, and animation
    - Need to research and pick some tech for this: P5, gsap etc
    - Design research helped me narrow down a font choice
        - I prefer simple and popular fonts, so I'll pick Roboto or Input (more developer oriented font, fits with the theme)
            - I may research a good all caps font, because it feels brave to have everything in all caps
