# 100 Days Of Code - Log

================

## Day 6

Date: 12/01/23

================

> Goal: make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Created a new page specifically for the 100days-of-code challenge -> /1hdoc
- Abstracted the backdrop component
- Learned about routing in Svelte

### **Thoughts**: 

- My layouts are a bit weird, so before I can jump in and make articles I need to create a more reading-focused design
