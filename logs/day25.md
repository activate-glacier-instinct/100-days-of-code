### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Foundry/forge: adds coverage report (100%)
- Foundry/anvil--local: started a local network
- Foundry/anvil--local: deployed the contract locally
- Foundry/cast--local: tested the deployed contract using cast
- Foundry/anvil--local: adds docs for this here - [Local Deploy / Testing (Anvil)](https://github.com/activate-glacier-instinct/foundry-whitelist-dapp--lw3#local-deploy--testing-anvil)
- Foundry/anvil--goerli: configured anvil to deploy to goerli
- Foundry/anvil--goerli: adds docs for this here - [Deploying - Goerli / Alchemy RPC](https://github.com/activate-glacier-instinct/foundry-whitelist-dapp--lw3#deploying---goerli--alchemy-rpc)
- Foundry/anvil--goerli: deployed the contract to Goerli
- Foundry/cast--goerli: tested the deployed contract using cast
- LearnWeb3: Completed Sophomore / Lesson 9 - verified the Goerli contract

### **Thoughts**: 

- Explore Foundry wallet production setups - [foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script.html#wallet-options---raw)
- Useful Foundry resources from Nader Dabit - [Foundry Workshop](https://github.com/dabit3/foundry-workshop) and [Foundry Cheatsheet](https://github.com/dabit3/foundry-cheatsheet) 
- Not sure if I still want to do the dApp using NextJS or using SvelteKit. Don't think I've seen any SvelteKit dApps yet soooo.....

### **Next up**:

- Frontend for the dApp
