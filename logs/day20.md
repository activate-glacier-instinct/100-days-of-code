## Day 20/100

---

Date: 26/01/23

### Goal: 

Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Slow day today, short day too
- Researched 3D tilt effects for the cards
- Implemented two approaches, but need to push further to resolve Typescript of Svelte specific bugs 

### **Thoughts**: 

- Decided to cut this short after a lack of productivity was noticed. Sometimes when you're too tired to solve a problem, you should probably just go to bed. 

### **Next**:

- Finish the /work cards
