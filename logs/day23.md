### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Foundry: received a reply and validated suggested workaround to the project creation as shared on https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4215
- Foundry: tested another example for `forge init`, wrote up a response, and posted that here https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4215#issuecomment-1407827193
- Getting used to Foundry from the basic project
- Created a new repo for the whitelist app
