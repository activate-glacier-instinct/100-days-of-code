### Goal:

Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Added some styles 
- Added color theme
- Learned about how to work with components in Svelte
- Added fixed main column
- Added font

### **Challenges**:
- No challenges today

### **Thoughts**: 

- The global styling is probably not right, but that is for another day
- Not sure the theme works, feels like Halloween theme
- The interactive Svelte resources are great https://svelte.dev/tutorial/named-slots
