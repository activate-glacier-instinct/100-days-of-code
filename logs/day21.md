### Goal: 

Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Implemented the 3D card tilt effect
- Added an Ethereum gradient shine inspired by the open design docs for the Ethereum website
- Added smooth animations
- Removed cruft 

### **Thoughts**: 

- The Ethereum website abides by open-design principles and I used their Figma to define an Ethereum gradient https://www.figma.com/file/NrNxGjBL0Yl1PrNrOT8G2B/ethereum.org-Design-System?node-id=71%3A517&t=9eyemU9f7sZsu5Ki-0
- There's more to do on the cards: maybe add links to the work, then the work should each have a page
- However I am going to move on to the next project from tomorrow. Happy with the portfolio as it is for a few months.
