## Day 29/100

### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in SvelteKit- LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Getting back into it after a bit of a break
- Debugging the broken build
- Fixing build configuration

### **Thoughts**: 

- Decided to add 2days break each week. This way I have more time to recharge, get all the adult stuff done, and possibly work through my maths curriculum.
- Broken build: 
    - CSS + JS assets not deploying correctly
    - Image assets are appearing, possibly because they're stored in static
    - Poorly configured `svelte.config` + bad placement of `.nojekyll`
