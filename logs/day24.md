### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Foundry: adds Whitelist contract
- Foundry: learned how to write tests, how to test reverts, how to mock addresses, how to assert
- Foundry: adds tests for Whitelist contract methods and properties.


### **Thoughts**: 

- Should attempt to make an MR on Foundry on the issue I raised here https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4215. A contributor recommended it as a good issues, and offered some pointers.
- Surprisingly straightforward to get up to speed with Foundry using the Foundry book https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests

### **Next up**:

- Deployment of the contract
