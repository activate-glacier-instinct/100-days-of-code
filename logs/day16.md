### Goal: 

Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Finalised the /blog/100days-of-code/[slug] designs, aka the logs pages
- Learned about how to style injected html content with Svelte
- Investigated creating web-components with Svelte, but ended up not using it
- Organised components under atomic design principles
- Bunch of code cleanup

### **Thoughts**: 
- Creating native web-components with Svelte seems interesting and useful. Glad that I've given this a try.

### **Next**:
- Improve the /work page with better content and examples
