### Goal: 

Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Ended the break by finishing up the portfolio
- Added a card-based design to the /work page
- Adds a data file for the /work cards 
- Adds component rendering from this new /work cards data json
- Adds components, styling, and adjusted the layout

### **Thoughts**: 

- That's it, tomorrow is the last day of this project as I'm moving over to smart contract work with LearnWeb3 DAO Sophomore track 

### **Next**:

- Finish the /work cards
