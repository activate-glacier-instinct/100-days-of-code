### Goal: 

Build a full NFT collection smart contract in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Foundry: hit a roadblock with testing the mints
- Foundry: removed the roadblock via mocks of the Whitelist
- Foundry: figured out how to instantiate a contact, get its address, then pass that to another contract which uses said address for an interface, all within Foundry test suite.
- Test Coverage at 36%
- Watched: [Austin Griffith - shill session with 0xTranqui](https://youtu.be/uWR78WyPSl4); good video explaining a number of Foundry features and Solidity patterns
