## Day 9

Date: 15/01/23

================

> Goal: make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- BUG: fix CI/CD build for the new dynamic pages on /blog/[slug]
- Dynamically created elements based on data - blog article links
- Adds Github file fetching - gets the logs from a repo
- Passes the data into the components
- Implements dynamic rendering from the fetched data
- Designed a specific data shape to enable the /blog/slug pages to fetch their own data too

### **Thoughts**: 

- Interesting data flow model in Svelte. Not used to it yet, but interesting.
