### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Setup Foundry on my machine
- Attempted a simple foundry hello-world example, and encountered a lot of issues
- Foundry: Raised a bug about `foundry init` circular dependencies - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4214
- Foundry: Raised a feature request to allow for project creation on systems that don't have git credentials configured globally - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4215

### **Thoughts**: 

- Foundry book is such a nice resource - https://book.getfoundry.sh/
- Wow, Foundry!!! No started today because of the above issues.
- Going to look at virtual environments tomorrow to overcome this and move forward
- Not a good look when I can't even install the `hello-world` sample
