## Day 8/100

### Goal:

Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Added blog post functionality to generate posts from a data file
- Created a dummy data file
- Added logic to load this data, pass the data to the component, or throw a 404 
- Added rendering logic to show this data
- Researched how to query the Github API for files
- Downloaded Insomnia to scaffold out those queries and include them in this repo

### **Thoughts**: 

- The blog post generation was wildly simple, but it was so because of all the available resources 
- Next step is to fetch my markdown files from my 100days-of-code and render them as blog posts
- I will need to parse the files from .md before rendering and this is why I included the body key on blog posts
- Will have to extend this sprint by 4 more days
- Will start talking about and setting the allocated time in Fibbonacci sequence.
