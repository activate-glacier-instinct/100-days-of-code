### Goal: 

Build a full NFT collection smart contract in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Created the NFT Collection scaffolding and repo
- Installed Openzeppelin dependencies
- Added the contracts 
- Went through the [Intro to Foundry - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNMfMxGxeag) from Patrick Collins to get a wider understanding of Foundry

### **Thoughts**: 

- Had some issues with the remappings. It was quite annoying since installing dependencies isn't really a niche behaviour. 
- Eventually fixed after reading the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solmate-nft)
- Wondering how I'm going to achieve the IWhitelist pattern here, as in how will I be sending the Whitelist address to the `IWhitelist` interface within Foundry? Maybe using bash scripting...
