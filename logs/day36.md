### Goal: 

Flipside Crypto - Kevin Abosch Open Edition query

### **Today's Progress**: 

- FlipsideCrypto: signed up
- FlipsideCrypto: learned about ETF and NFT data and how to product mint queries
- FlipsideCrypto: created a dashboard about Open Edition by Kevin Abosch

### **Thoughts**:

- Departure from the usual, although data analytics is part of my 100days-of-code plan
- Flipside Crypto has been on my radar for a while, but the learning curve is steeper when compared to Dune Analytics
- Useful video series: [Flipside Cryto - Blockchain SQL Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymgtf44KgbI)
- Quite nice to get back into this, my last Dune Analytics dashboard was from late last year. I'm appreciating the in-depth learning content
