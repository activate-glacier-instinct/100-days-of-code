## Day 39/100

### Goal: 

Build a full NFT collection smart contract in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Debugged and resolved `-32000` error from redeploying
- Redeployed the contract
- Reployed the dApp
- Minted the NFT and passed the lesson on LW3

## **Thoughts**: 

- Surprised at just how early I am vs the roadmap, so I'm going to finish the FlipsideCrypto dashboard for the next few days
- Admin: made [plan.md](../plan.md) be the current tracker of the challenge, whilst [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) is the future looking document.

### **Next**: 

- Continue the `flipside.crypto` dashboard build
