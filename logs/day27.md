### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in SvelteKit- LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Implemented the NextJS example in Svelte
- Learned more aboute WalletConnect/web3modal
- Svelte: Learned more about stores, contexts, conditional rendering, lifecycle methods 

### **Thoughts**: 

- Spent too long dissecting how the web3Modal works using [this implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/j43b10?file=/src/App.js), referenced in the [WalletConnect/web3modal repo](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal)
- Spent time looking at the Svelte native implementation svelte-web3 - [repo](https://github.com/clbrge/svelte-web3)
- Nearly went with this [svelte-web3 example](https://github.com/clbrge/svelte-web3/tree/master/examples/sveltekit-app-template-web3)
- Then I just realised that I'm complicating things, so I came back to the given NextJS example and just tweaked to work with the Svelte api
- Used this repo to find `React to Svelte` hook / lifecycle mappings - [react-hooks-in-svelte](https://github.com/joshnuss/react-hooks-in-svelte)
