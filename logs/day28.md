### Goal: 

Build a full whitelist dApp in SvelteKit- LW3 Sophomore track

### **Today's Progress**: 

- Componentised the page a bit by creating a layout + main page
- Configured the pages to build as static files
- Configured a CI/CD Github Action to build and deploy the site to Github Pages
- Deployed site 

### **Thoughts**: 

- Existing issues with the deployed build. File linking seems to be broken atm, fix is in progress
- Looking to start on the next project tomorrow or the following day
